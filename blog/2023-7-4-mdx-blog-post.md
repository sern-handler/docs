Hey everyone! Today we have very special news for you all: We're changing our logo!

# Why?

You see, on today's standards, having a simple logo is essential. Our logo aligns perfectly with these design principles but it can always be improved.  
We were chilling, you know, cooking sern handler v3, sern gui, `npm create @sern/bot` and serncord when we thought about changing the logo to a sleek design with less colors.  
And here we are!

# Who did our new branding?

[Ropox](https://github.com/Murtatrxx)!  
Bro's the GOAT. This website is maintained by him, the domain costs are funded by him and also he started brainstorming how the logo would be on paper:

And there it all clicked:

Pretty nice!

By the way, we have animations and variations on the way, so make sure to stay updated in the [discord server](https://sern.dev/discord)!

# Finally, from the entire sern team, thank you for sticking around ❤️
