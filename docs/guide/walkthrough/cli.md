# CLI

Setting up the [CLI](https://github.com/sern-handler/cli) is easy. <br />
The cli is your plug to the sern ecosystem. This will allow you to install plugins with ease, install extra utilities, and much more.
If you haven't yet: 
```sh
npm install -g @sern/cli
```

- To install [plugins](plugins.md) maintained by the community [repository](https://github.com/sern-handler/awesome-plugins),

```
sern plugins
```
:::info
Make sure to have a correct [sern.config.json](./good-to-know.md#sernconfigjson)
:::


This will display a menu selection of all installable plugins. <br />

**Note**: You must have a [sern.config.json](good-to-know.md) to use this command.
If you want to view plugins, visit the repository linked above.

- To install extra utilities into your project
```
sern extra
```

We have a more in depth [guide](../../cli/README.md) of the CLI
